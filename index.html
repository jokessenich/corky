            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>How many times can you cheat death on your path to
                enlightenment? Meet Ralph "Corky" Matson, a modern-day
                urban shaman who consistently beats the odds. In this
                captivating memoir, Matson leads us through Woodstock,
                down drug alleys, over mountain ashrams and around
                gamblers on a never-ending quest for higher consciousness
                as he struggles with his inner demons—and angels. Born to
                a devoted mother who struggled to protect him from the
                unjustified hatred of a tyrannical father, Matson grew up in
                poverty with a negative self-image that haunted him even as
                he associated with remarkable people such as Ram Dass,
                Timothy Leary, Rammurti S. Mishra, Swami Rama, Elias
                DeMohan and Patricia Cota Robles. His many brushes with
                death, including accidents, tumors, overdoses and heart
                failure only confirmed his spiritual beliefs and demonstrated
                the miraculous power of healing. Journey with him as he not
                only overcomes the hardships of an uncertain early life, but
                grieves the loss of two wives to illness and forgives the
                
                father who tormented him. There is a tangible love felt in
                these pages, for every character we encounter. Even in his
                depictions of heartbreak or cruelty, Matson generously
                renders a world—and a philosophy—of devotion, kindness,
                and perseverance that is the underlying thread of his life
                story. Edgy, yet inspirational, Prodigious Son: A Memoir of
                Miracles offers hope and spiritual awakening in the middle of
                despair.</p>
